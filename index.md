## About Me

I thrive on solving problems and building things that work. I’m still learning, but I’ve started creating responsive interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and developing backends with Java, Spring, and MySQL.

I enjoy turning ideas into functional, user-focused solutions and love tackling challenges that help me grow. Technology excites me because there’s always something new to learn and a better way to build.
